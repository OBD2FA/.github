## Pull Request Information

The following is the template for pull requests. It is important to follow the
template as your commits will be squashed before being merged into `main` and the
squash commit will be the pull request title + description.

The pull request title should match the first line: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

The first line of the pull request description should be the `body` if a body is
being included. Followed by a blank line and then a line with the issue number and
a line with the pull request number. Keeping the `#` is important because it will
create the links back to issues inside GitHub.

[here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
